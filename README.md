# Go-Chat-App

## Overview

Go-Chat-App is a mobile messaging application built with a modern tech stack to provide seamless communication between users. It features a user-friendly interface for creating and managing chat groups, sending messages, and interacting with friends in real time.

The front end is built using **React Native**, ensuring compatibility across Android and iOS devices. The back end is powered by **Go** and the **Gin Web Framework**, delivering a high-performance API for managing authentication, chats, and messaging services.

The main purpose of this application was to study not only Go and Gin as the backend technologies and React as the frontend framework, but also to explore the implementation of a small yet efficient WebSocket protocol, enabling users to send and receive messages in real-time.
